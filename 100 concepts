mongodb - joins at application layer, not at db layer as data are partitioned on multiple servers

two types of index in dynamodb: 
global secondary index - GSi - this is for all the partitions
local secondary index - LSi - this is for single partition

HA- High Availability

stateless servers - two or more servers can provide HA 
statefull servers - master server can provide read/write, slave can provide read. Replication happens from master to secondary.

Health checks - way for load balancer to ensure request handling servers are healthy

DNS - Domain Name servers. In dns, we can provide ips of multiple load balances and maintian HA

Metric to define load on server 
RPS: requests per second
TPS: transactions per second
QPS: Queries per second

Zookeeper is a centralized service for monitoring configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization and providing group service.

Gossip protocal:  cluster nodes talk gossip with each otherto make each other aware of the current state.

Paxos: Popular consensus protocol. The goal of the paxos algorithm is for some number of peers to reach aggrement on a value.

New Relic: Metrics
